Flight Delay Analysis

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing U.S. flight delay patterns to identify key factors contributing to delays and cancellations. The goal is to uncover insights that can help improve airline performance and enhance passenger experience.

Using a dataset of 5.8 million flight records, we performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to answer critical questions such as:

Which airlines are most and least punctual?

What are the most common causes of flight delays?

How do delays vary by time (weekday, month, season)?

Which airports and states experience the highest delays and cancellations?

**Key Insights**

Over 36% of flights were delayed in the analyzed period.

Delta Air Lines recorded the lowest delay rate (28.82%), while Spirit Airlines (49.38%) had the highest.

Delays are more frequent on weekdays and peak in summer months (Juneâ€“July).

Major causes of delay are almost evenly distributed: Airline Operations, Air System, and Weather.

Southwest Airlines accounted for the highest share of delays and cancellations.

California and Texas recorded the highest flight volumes, with Texas leading in cancellations.
